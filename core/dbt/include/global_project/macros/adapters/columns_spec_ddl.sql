# Verify global macro is dispatched and can be overridden elegantly in any adapter(I can do this by creating a custom macro in the dbt-postgres equivalent adapter)
# I may not need this if I can use the global macro version to be the dbt-postgres default OR I can simply duplicate code by calling the global macro in the dbt-postgres adapter
